        <p>
          I'm a full stack developer working part-time at EdPlus at ASU and I'm
          currently pursuing MS in CS at ASU. Prior to this, I worked as a
          software engineer at Moonraft innovation Labs,Bengaluru for 2 years. I
          am a graduate of RNS Institute of technology, Bengaluru, where I
          majored in Computer Science Degree. I currently live in Tempe, Az.
          When Iâ€™m not keeping busy with coding, I enjoy travelling and cooking.
          Moving around a lot inspired me to travel and explore the world around
          me. I love meeting new people and learning about the places they come
          from. I believe traveling is the best way to make new friends. I've
          travelled to almost all parts of India. I moved to Arizona last year
          and I hope to continue to keep vising new places. My other hobbies are
          cooking and soccer. I love to cook and I'm getting pretty good at it.
          Along with my friends I recently started an
          <a
            class="a-tag"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.instagram.com/az.adugemane/"
          >Instagram</a>
          account to share some photos of the food we cook. I also love to play
          soccer and video games. I used to play soccer regularly before COVID
          hit the world. I love to watch soccer as well, my favorite team is FC
          Barcelona.
